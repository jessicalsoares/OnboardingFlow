# OnboardingFlow

OnboardingFlow is an application designed to guide first-time users through its main features, creating a welcoming and intuitive onboarding experience.

This app was developed as part of a hands‚Äëon study in SwiftUI, based on the official Apple tutorial.

# Features
- **Onboarding Flow**  
  Swipeable onboarding screens that introduce the app‚Äôs core functions.

- **Page Indicators**  
  Visual dots indicating the current page in the onboarding sequence.

- **"Get Started" Button**  
  Completes onboarding and transitions users to the main app content.

- **Persistent State**  
  Tracks whether onboarding has been completed using `UserDefaults`, so it only shows once.

# Learnings
While building this app, I learned how to:

- Using `TabView` and `PageTabViewStyle` to build swipeable onboarding views;
- Managing first-time user state with `@AppStorage` or `UserDefaults` flags;
- Implementing simple navigation logic to switch views after onboarding;
- Working with SwiftUI state management using `@State` and `@Binding`;
